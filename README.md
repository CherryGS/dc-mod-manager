# DC Mod Manager app for Android

DC Mod Manager is an app for Android that lets you browse mods/skins and install them with a single click. These are only cosmetic changes, and do not effect gameplay in any.

Please report any issues or suggest features [here](https://github.com/PhasmaExMachina/dc-mod-manager/issues).

## Installation & Updates

You can download the latest APK from the [releases page](https://github.com/PhasmaExMachina/dc-mod-manager/releases) by expanding the "Assets" ropdown under the latest release. The easiest way is to download it from your Android phone and install it that way. See [What is an APK and how do you install one?](https://www.androidpit.com/android-for-beginners-what-is-an-apk-file) or [ask Google](http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=how+to+install+apk) if you get stuck.

**[Download latest APK v0.0.5](https://github.com/PhasmaExMachina/dc-mod-manager/releases/download/v0.0.5/dcmodmanager-v0.0.5.apk)** - Check [releases](https://github.com/PhasmaExMachina/dc-mod-manager/releases) too just in case this readme is outdated. Note, that people have reported BlueStacks has issues with DC Mod Manager. Try [LDPlayer](https://www.ldplayer.net/) instead. It's a better emulator anyway.

Updating is as easy as installing the newest APK on top of the old one. Automatically checking for updates with easy one click upgrade is [planned](https://github.com/PhasmaExMachina/dc-mod-manager/issues/1).

## Credits

This app is powered by the [Destiny Child Mods Archive](https://github.com/PhasmaExMachina/destiny-child-mods-archive) project. The mods in themselves are created by many different people. The goal was always to credit each modder on [the site](https://phasmaexmachina.github.io/destiny-child-mods-archive/) and in this app, but that's a _lot_ of manual work. Check out [this issue](https://github.com/PhasmaExMachina/destiny-child-mods-archive/issues/2) if you want to help out with the initiative.

Many other coders and artists have done work over the years that has made this app possible including, but not limited to:

* [Loki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki) - Modder and author of original mod archive and DC Mod Manager apps, now vanished.
* [Arsylk](https://github.com/Arsylk) - Live2D viewer implementation, [mods forum](https://arsylk.pythonanywhere.com/apk/view_models), swapping, and much more
